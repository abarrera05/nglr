# nglr syllabus

## Daily logistics

* Take roll.

## Entire class outline 

* Build a historical example using `walkthroughs/hello`.
    * Do dom manipulation, AJAX, etc.
* Show the classic TODO example with angular in `demos/todo`.
* Start building the contact example with `walkthroughs/contact`.
    * Work in the branch `walkthrough-contact`.
    * Tag each major step. 
* Intermission/lab: `notepad`.
    * Before starting the first time, show the completed version.
    * Work in the branch `lab-notepad`.
    * Tag each lab step when done.
* Final exam: `chat` example.
    * This is a bit of a free for all with a lot of the code already implemented.
    * Work in the branch `lab-chat`.
    * Tag the final step (in fact, probably doesn't need any tagging).
* When done, push all tags and branches to remote.
